## Repository Description

+ This repository was created just as instructed by the author of the program. 
+ It contains directories that help assists anyone new to the python programming language.
+ Inside the directories are various tasks that instruct the learner on respectfully adjusting to the python language.
+ Make sure to carefully read all the README.md files as they each contain important key points to consider for a better understanding of the programs..
+ **NOTE**: *This repo and all of its contents exist for learning purposes.*

### Zen (Python) 

<details>
<summary>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters</summary>
<br>
Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
Simple is better than complex.<br>
Complex is better than complicated.<br>
Flat is better than nested.<br>
Sparse is better than dense.<br>
Readability counts.<br>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br>
Although practicality beats purity.<br>
Errors should never pass silently.<br>
Unless explicitly silenced.<br>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br>
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br>
Now is better than never.<br>
Although never is often better than *right* now.<br>
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br>
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## Installation

To start programming in Python, you'll need to set up your environment. Follow these steps for a smooth start:

1. **Python Interpreter**: Install the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to check the option that adds Python to your system's PATH during installation.

2. **Choosing an Editor**:
Next, choose an editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and run your Python code. Here are a few popular options:

- **Visual Studio Code**: Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It has excellent support for Python and provides a variety of extensions.

- **PyCharm**: JetBrains' [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a powerful IDE designed specifically for Python development.

3. **Writing Your First Python Program**:
Open your chosen editor and create a new file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `0-test.py`). Then, 
you can refer to [0-test.py](https://github.com/hunterxcobby/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/lessons/exercises/0-test.py) as a guide to your first program.

Save the file and open a terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory where you saved `0-test.py` and type `python3 0-test.py` to run the program. You should see `Hello, World, let us do great things together.` printed in the terminal.

4. **Documentation**:
[Pycodestyle -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/)

6. **Additional Resources**:
For more detailed information and tutorials, consider referring to the official [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/). It's an excellent resource for both beginners and experienced developers.
